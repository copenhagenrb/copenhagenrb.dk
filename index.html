        <h2>What is Ruby?</h2>
        <p>
          Ruby is a dynamic, general purpose, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.
          It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is a highly object oriented language designed to be "more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python" and draws inspiration from languages like Lisp and Smalltalk.

        <h2>About the group</h2>

        <p>
          <a href="http://copenhagenrb.dk" title="Ruby and Rails User Group in KÃ¸benhavn, Denmark">Copenhagen Ruby Brigade</a> is a loosely organized group of Ruby enthusiasts in or near <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=copenhagen,+denmark&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=50.111473,68.554688&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=12&amp;iwloc=addr" title="Where in the world is Copenhagen?">Copenhagen, Denmark</a>.
          We get together roughly every month to listen to presentations, discuss issues, and generally socialize with like-minded geeks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Wether you're a seasoned Ruby hacker or have never written a single line of Ruby code, you're welcome at our meetings.
          All we require is an interest in Ruby, and preferably a willingness to join the discussions or perhaps even present a topic.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our main language is Danish, but if you ask nicely most people are willing to switch to English.
          Don't let language barriers stop you from attending.
